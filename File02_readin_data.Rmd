## Read in your data

Now let's read back in the "mydata.Rdata". This should speed up your work - assuming that creating this "mydata.Rdata" took some time to prepare and create.

Show that the current RMD session is empty.

```{r}
ls()
```

Now load the objects in "mydata.Rdata" and look at the list again.

```{r}
load("mydata.Rdata")
ls()
```

Now your objects are ready to use. Here is the plot of the normal curve density data again.

```{r}
plot(x, xnorm, type = "b")
```

Show summary of the `AMS` dataset.

```{r}
summary(AMS)
```
